# House Rules & Table Conventions

## Table conventions

- We play rules-as-intended; quick rulings in session, review after.
- Player-facing rolls: players roll attacks/saves; DM rolls hidden info.
- Phones: okay for sheets/notes; minimize distractions.

## Core house rules

- Flanking: +2 to hit (instead of advantage).
- Potions: bonus action to drink, action to administer.
- Crits: roll damage dice twice (no max-die).

## Session tools

- Lines & veils are respected.
- Anyone can call for a pause.
